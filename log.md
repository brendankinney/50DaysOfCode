# 50 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I spent an hour today to launch my front-end project of a tribute page using CodePen. You can see my progress [here:](https://codepen.io/bkinney/full/YQXpaX/). I cheated somewhat by copying the initial code from the example, just as a way of getting started. Once I understand how the various div classes impact the design, I will play some more. I chose MLK Jr. as my tribute subject and use the info from his Wikipedia entry. I like the fact that CodePen helps you separate the various coding aspects: HTML, CSS, JS...definitely a help for a beginner!

**Thoughts:** Again, having some kind of intro tutorial would be helpful for me as a learner. I can see this is one project where I'll need to rely on outside help or tips. For example, even though I copied the initial code from the example, my contents were not showing up neatly centered and despite NO differences in the code, it appears aligned-left. I might try to use basic HTML (foregoing the use of div) to see if I can make it work.

### Day 3: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I completed 17 challenges, primarily on how to use jQuery (my first JavaScript library!). I used it to animage elements of the page, change the color of elements, clone, append, and more. I ended after a short introduction to CodePen, an online editor and testing environment that helps you create code snippets that can be shared. The net phase of the work will involve building a ["tribute page" like this one](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW) using CodePen.

**Thoughts:** Definitely a bit of a struggle today as my son had a little league baseball game and we didn't get home until 8:30 p.m. Once I got to the computer, the hour went by pretty quickly. One thing I wish FreeCodeCamp offered was a short "What is jQuery" intro for whatever big concept is offered (Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, jQuery, etc.). There is something to be said for jumping right into the coding, but I like to have my bearings first. Instead, I found myself on the fifth jQuery challenge asking..."What is jQuery and why shoould I care?"). A brief primer would help with context. I find myself using Wikipedia to get a quick definition and description.

### Day 2: June 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I completed 27 challenges in FreeCodeCamp, primarily focused on Bootstrap div elements and styling and buttons and just started to get into jQuery. My Cat Photo App is coming along nicely :-)

**Thoughts:** It's amazing how every quote and dash really matters. In addition to coding, I spent time working on my side web project, making modifications to the Wordpress site, playing with the embed functions of Issuu and I installed a Dokuwiki to test whether or not we should use it for the articles.

### Day 1: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Jumped back into FreeCodeCamp and focused on CSS styles, declarations, and more. Also played with the various ways you can use color besides text names including hex code and rgb. Finally, I got into bootstrap and responsive design by creating a responsive image and adding a bootstrap button.

**Thoughts:** I tried using my new Raspberry Pi Zero W for coding but it was wa too slow and cumbersome. I switched to one of my Raspberry Pi 3s and was soon humming along. The difference in performance is significant (probably no surprise, but I really was hoping the Zero could do the job). It felt good to kick off my challenge. A reminder: I chose 50 days instead of 100 because it's exactly 50 days until we leave for camp, where I won't have any reliable computer access for 14 days.
