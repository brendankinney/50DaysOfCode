# 50 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Jumped back into FreeCodeCamp and focused on CSS styles, declarations, and more. Also played with the various ways you can use color besides text names including hex code and rgb. Finally, I got into bootstrap and responsive design by creating a responsive image and adding a bootstrap button.

**Thoughts:** I tried using my new Raspberry Pi Zero W for coding but it was wa too slow and cumbersome. I switched to one of my Raspberry Pi 3s and was soon humming along. The difference in performance is significant (probably no surprise, but I really was hoping the Zero could do the job). It felt good to kick off my challenge. A reminder: I chose 50 days instead of 100 because it's exactly 50 days until we leave for camp, where I won't have any reliable computer access for 14 days.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
