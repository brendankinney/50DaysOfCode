# 50 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: June 11, 2017 ###

**Today's Progres:** More work on my personal profile page. Experimented with more Bootstrap elements but am having difficulty figuring out how to make the top nav bar render horizontally, versus stacked! Very frustrating, because in another test program it worked. Not sure if it's me or an issue with CodePen. I also refreshed my memory on anchors and bookmarks within a page and how to insert horizontal lines. I was having difficulty with a bottom line for a section when it finally hit me to use a closing div tag. That was a bit of an "aha" moment that each div contains elements and the missing closing tag was the problem.

**Thoughts:** I was really frustrated today with the nav bar. I tried all kinds of variations to make it render properly, but no dice. If it would work as it's supposed to, I'd be close to finishing this challenge! I should also go back and play with image sizing; to eliminate the issues I was having, I am using the same image for each thumbnail so they appear uniform...but I should learn if there is a way to make the images in a "gallery" size the same.

### Day 7: June 10, 2017

**Special Announcement:** You may notice that there is no entry for June 9. Friday night was super busy for our family and we had a house full of unexpected guests. Despite the skip, I'm keeping the number of days in order, so today is Day 7 of working on code. I am not surprised that I skipped a day given life, work, family, and other commitments. I won't lose any sleep over it if you won't!

**Today's Progress:** I'm also not being a purist when it comes to this challenge. According to the rules, watching tutorials, videos, adn the like aren't actually coding, so don't count. As you may have rad in the previous entries, I felt like I was missing "overviews" about the general topic areas. And since I'm working on my portfolio page in CodePen which encourages Bootstrap, I found a VERY helpful series of videos and have watched five of them today and played around with my Bootstrap code of the porfolio as a result. There are other videos about HTML, CSS, Javascript and more, so I will be integrating these into the coding challengs of FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I've shared many thoughts already, but I have to say that being a runner is helping me continue on this journey. After missing a day, some people might throw up their hands and feel the need to start over or give up altogether. Not me. Many miles and many races has taught me that it's okay to have small setbacks. Learning is not necessarily a linear path. I appreciate the basic premise of the challenge and will do my best not to miss any/many more days, but if being rigid about the rules of the challenge stops me in my tracks from learning code, then what good is it?

**Link to work:** Here's [a link to the video series I'm using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3e24Of44ac&list=PL0eyrZgxdwhx2XiwAfPLTTnEPcUGrPGH-) to help me better understand Bootstrap. In other news, I put a [call out on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/brendankinney/status/873272496849645569) about working to establish Code Clubs for each school district in Vermont and it's generating some discussion. I'm going to pursue this idea and see if we can get something going!

### Day 6: June 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** After finishing up my tribute project, next up is the creation of a personal portoflio page similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB/). I am experimenting more with Bootstrap elements and did not copy the code from the example, However, I've been finding helpful Bootstrap tips online and copying the sample code and modifying it for my purposes. (Is this cheating?). It definitely was slow going, but I was able to build basic Bootstrap buttons that link to my social media accounts and a panel of portfolio examples. I cannot figure out how to make an image fit into a column so they appear uniform! I'll research and tackle this tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm getting into somewhat of a routine. I have to say that it's a challenge to sit down after a long day and commit to an hour of coding. I must persevere! I'm almost a full week in...

### Day 5: June 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Definitely not feeling it today! I woke up early for a run, had a full day of work, and then a little league playoff game where I had to step in for the coach who was out of town on business. Excuses, excuses, right? Anyway, I worked on my triute page and mainly fiddled with various HTML and CSS elements to see how the page design changed. I went old school with HTML skills from the 1990s and left Bootstrap mostly behind. I'd like to revisit the code and see if I can use more Bootstrap elements before I finish the challenge.

**Thoughts:** I did not honor the challenge by coming up with code from scratch, which makes me feel unworthy! I am still feeling too new to come up with code on my own and so borrowed some code from the example and elsewhere by looking up code questions. The onle thing I am proud of is figuring out how to use CSS to align the bullet list on the page.

### Day 4: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I spent an hour today to launch my front-end project of a tribute page using CodePen. You can see my progress [here](https://codepen.io/bkinney/full/YQXpaX/). I cheated somewhat by copying the initial code from the example, just as a way of getting started. Once I understand how the various div classes impact the design, I will play some more. I chose MLK Jr. as my tribute subject and use the info from his Wikipedia entry. I like the fact that CodePen helps you separate the various coding aspects: HTML, CSS, JS...definitely a help for a beginner!

**Thoughts:** Again, having some kind of intro tutorial would be helpful for me as a learner. I can see this is one project where I'll need to rely on outside help or tips. For example, even though I copied the initial code from the example, my contents were not showing up neatly centered and despite NO differences in the code, it appears aligned-left. I might try to use basic HTML (foregoing the use of div) to see if I can make it work.

### Day 3: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I completed 17 challenges, primarily on how to use jQuery (my first JavaScript library!). I used it to animage elements of the page, change the color of elements, clone, append, and more. I ended after a short introduction to CodePen, an online editor and testing environment that helps you create code snippets that can be shared. The net phase of the work will involve building a ["tribute page" like this one](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW) using CodePen.

**Thoughts:** Definitely a bit of a struggle today as my son had a little league baseball game and we didn't get home until 8:30 p.m. Once I got to the computer, the hour went by pretty quickly. One thing I wish FreeCodeCamp offered was a short "What is jQuery" intro for whatever big concept is offered (Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, jQuery, etc.). There is something to be said for jumping right into the coding, but I like to have my bearings first. Instead, I found myself on the fifth jQuery challenge asking..."What is jQuery and why shoould I care?"). A brief primer would help with context. I find myself using Wikipedia to get a quick definition and description.

### Day 2: June 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I completed 27 challenges in FreeCodeCamp, primarily focused on Bootstrap div elements and styling and buttons and just started to get into jQuery. My Cat Photo App is coming along nicely :-)

**Thoughts:** It's amazing how every quote and dash really matters. In addition to coding, I spent time working on my side web project, making modifications to the Wordpress site, playing with the embed functions of Issuu vs. Scribd. I also installed a Dokuwiki and MediaWiki to test whether or not we should use it for the articles.

### Day 1: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Jumped back into FreeCodeCamp and focused on CSS styles, declarations, and more. Also played with the various ways you can use color besides text names including hex code and rgb. Finally, I got into bootstrap and responsive design by creating a responsive image and adding a bootstrap button.

**Thoughts:** I tried using my new Raspberry Pi Zero W for coding but it was wa too slow and cumbersome. I switched to one of my Raspberry Pi 3s and was soon humming along. The difference in performance is significant (probably no surprise, but I really was hoping the Zero could do the job). It felt good to kick off my challenge. A reminder: I chose 50 days instead of 100 because it's exactly 50 days until we leave for camp, where I won't have any reliable computer access for 14 days.
